# Hahn.ApplicatonProcess.Application
Hahn Softwareentwicklung Code Test Attempt

This is a Domain Driven Design Web API project using ASP.NET 5.0, Docker-Compose, Swagger, Fluent Validation and Serilog.
It is my submission for the above Code Test set by Hahn Softwareentwicklung and it is complete with all required features.
To run the WebAPI project in Visual Studio, simply select the Docker Compose run configuration and press the Start button
(green arrow). For this to work Docker must be installed on the host computer. Alternatively, select the web project 
configuration and run the project without Docker. The application will then open a browser window and Swagger will then 
be available to the user.
